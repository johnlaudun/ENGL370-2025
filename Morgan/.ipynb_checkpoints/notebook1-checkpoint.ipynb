    "Hi! My name is A'Nyrion, I'm an only child and I was born at 29 1/2 weels weighing 1 pound.I played varsity volleyball througout highschool. I graduated number 19 in my class as cum laude with a 3.7 grade point average. I will be the first college graduate out of my family and I am working hard to make them and myself proud. My favorite colors at the moment is pink, yellow, and sometime orange. Unfortunately, I am  not a pet person so I do not have a pet name. As far as the Super Bowl, I really do not pay attention to football to know who is the greater team but from what I am seeing on social media I think the Philadelphia Eagles will win the Bowl.\n"
