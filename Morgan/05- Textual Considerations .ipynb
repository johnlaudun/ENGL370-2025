    "A text is any written or spoken material that conveys information or ideas. It can be anything from a book, article, or essay to a conversation, speech, or even a social media post.You can recognize a text by its structure and the way it uses language to communicate meaning. Written texts often have sentences, paragraphs, and punctuation while spoken texts have a flow of speech with pauses and intonation. Essentially, if it communicates something through language, its a text."
