Whispering of nuns at prayer.

Nuns at prayer; MOTHER MIRIAM, the Superior closes the gate and locks

it.

EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

A single shot of the building.

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

SISTER MARGUERITE is locking up for the night, shutting doors,

turning off lights, finally walks off down the corridor. Suddenly a

terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman.

EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

Lights in the windows flick on.

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps,

calling    urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room

and try    the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood

stained    figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying...

                                         MOTHER SUPERIOR

                          Agnes!... Agnes...

EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

An ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the

siren and stops outside the convent gates. The nuns open the gate and

the ambulance drives inside.

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Two PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the

unconscious figure of Sister Agnes. The Mother Superior desperately

wipes and kisses her face.

                                         PARAMEDIC

                         I'm just going to put something here to

                         stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister.

                         She'll be fine.

They lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall.

The Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into...

INT - SISTER AGNES' ROOM - NIGHT

She kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and

starts to pull them out. Then she freezes, makes the sign of the

cross and starts to weep.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT - MONTREAL - NIGHT

An aerial shot of the great cross of Montreal. Superimposed over this

are the words

"MONTREAL, QUEBEC".

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT - SUPREME COURT - DAY

A normal busy day. A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The

woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man (LARRY), gets out of

the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of

the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle

of interest.

                                        REPORTER

                         Here they are now.

Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister

Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and

their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters

leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and

French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is

quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse.

INT - JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY

Inside EVE, LYON, and JUSTICE LEVEAU are sitting. Martha is standing

by the window smoking furiously.

                                        LEVEAU

                         Martha, it's you.

                                      MARTHA

                       What about Roger? He's free.

                                      EVE

                       They want a woman.

                                      LYON

                       All you have to do is meet with her

                       once or twice... then tell the court

                       she's insane.

                                      MARTHA

                       Are you dictating my position to me?

                       We're getting into some sticky legal

                       territories here.

                                      EVE

                       Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants

                       this to come to trial, not the Church, not

                       the Crown... least of all me.

                                      MARTHA

                       Eve, she strangled a baby!

                                      EVE

                       Nobody is interested in sending a nun

                       to prison.

                                      LEVEAU

                       We're not telling you what to decide

                       Martha. We're not even telling you to

                       take this.

                                      LYON

                       Is there any reason why you feel you

                       shouldn't take it?

       Martha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns.

                                      MARTHA

                       Today's my birthday. I always make

                       bad decisions on my birthday.

The Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle. The Judge throws the file down

on his desk towards her.

                                         LEVEAU

                       Happy birthday.

15   INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Martha unlocks the door and comes in. She plays her

answerphone

and moves over to her cat.

                                         MARTHA

                       Hi, Kitty.

       The answerphone whirs...

                                      SECRETARY (V.O.)

                       Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you

                       that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm

                       her appointment at nine o'clock

                       tomorrow, okay? Bye bye.

       Some whirs and clicks.

                                         ROGER (V.O.)

                       Hi Martha,    it's Roger. Can you call

                       me at the    hospital. I'd like your opinion

                       on a case.    Oh, bye the way, happy

                       birthday.    Bye.

                                      SECRETARY (V.O.)

                       Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled

                       your Wednesday afternoon appointment

                       so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye.

                                        MAN

                                (in French)

                       ???

        Martha picks up a news paper with a photo of Sister Agnes on

the front.

       DISSOLVE TO:

16   EXT - CONVENT - DAY

        Martha pulls up in her BMW outside the convent walls and gets

out, cigarette

        in hand. A sign tangled over with creeper reads "Les Petites

Soeurs de Marie Madeleine". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she

presses a buzzer. A   peephole in the door slams open and Sister

Marguerite looks out.

                                      MARTHA

                       Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha

                       Livingston, I...

        The peephole slams shut, but the door does open. Sister

Marguerite glares at her.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)

                       Hello... I'm Doctor Martha

                       Living...ston... I...

        Martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the

trouble

and hastily     grinds it underfoot.

                                         MARTHA (Cont.)

                       Excuse me... I'm...

        Sister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt. Martha

awkwardly tries

        to kick it away.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)

                       ...the court-appointed psychiatrist.

        Sister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and

motions for her to    come in.

                                      MARTHA (Cont.)

                       Thank you. I um... I believe your

                       Mother Superior's expecting me.

       Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent.

17   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY

        Martha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room.

Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then

the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees

Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight

start.

                                       MOTHER SUPERIOR

                               (beaming at her own

                                       little joke)

                       Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm

                       Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call

                       Mother if you don't wish.

                               (shaking hands)

                       Most people find it uncomfortable.

                                        MARTHA

                       Well... I...

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                               (carrying right on)

                       I'm afraid the word brings up the most

                       unpleasant connatations in this day and

                       age...

                                        MARTHA

                       Yes... I...

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       You can call me Sister.

                                        MARTHA

                       ... Thank you.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       You must have tons of questions. You

                       may smoke if you want to. Just don't

                       tell any of the Sisters.

       Martha sits;   Mother Miriam gets her a box of matches.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)

                       They wouldn't understand, especially

                       Sister Marguerite. She'd scare the pants

                       off Queen Elizabeth.

                                (she lights Martha's cigarette)

                       Besides, I miss them.

                                      MARTHA

                       You were a smoker?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       Two packs a day.

                                      MARTHA

                       I can beat that.

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM

                       Unfiltered.

        Martha inclines her head impressed. Mother Miriam sits down

next to her.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.)

                       Well, you have questions.

                               (checks her watch)

                       Fire away...

                                      MARTHA

                       Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM

                       No-one.

                                      MARTHA

                       How did she hide it from the other nuns?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       She undressed alone... she bathed alone.

                                         MARTHA

                       Is that normal?

                                         MOTHER MIRIAM

                       Yes.

                                      MARTHA

                       How did she hide it during the day?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                               (indicating her habit)

                       She could have hidden a machine gun in

                       here if she had wanted to.

                                      MARTHA

                       Didn't she have any physical examinations

                       in this time?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy

                       fell in between the doctor's visits.

                                      MARTHA

                       Who was the father?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       I haven't a clue.

                                      MARTHA

                       What man had access to her?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       None as far as I know.

                                      MARTHA

                       Was there a priest?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                       Yes, but I...

                                      MARTHA

                       What's his name?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                       Father Martineau, but I don't see him

                       as a candidate.

                                      MARTHA

                       Could there have been anyone else?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                               (a pause)

                       Obviously there was.

                                      MARTHA

                       And you didn't try to find out who?

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                               (standing)

                       Believe me, I've done everything possible

                       short of asking Agnes.

                                      MARTHA

                       Why haven't you asked her?

        Mother Miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and

brings

it back to

        use as an ashtray.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM

                               (sitting again)

                       She can't even remember the birth. Do

                       you think she'd admit to the conception?

                                      MARTHA

                       Look, someone gave her the baby.

                                      MOTHER    MIRIAM

                       Yes, but that was some    ten months ago.

                       I fail to see that the    identity of that

                       somebody has anything    to do with this

                       trial.

                                      MARTHA

                       Why do you think that?

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM

                       Don't ask me those questions dear,
