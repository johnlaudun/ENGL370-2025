      "Girl and dog\n",
      "The eight children at the Lodge were not particularly pretty, neither were they particularly good, but they had warm, affectionate little hearts, and I suppose that, as each baby brings love into the world with it, there was eight times the amount of love in the cottage that there was at the Hall.\n",

      "When the children at the cottage looked curiously at the little lady in her velvet and fur, their mother used to be ashamed of them, and tell them that beauty was only skin-deep, and it was better to be good than pretty--and they all believed her except Bet, and on that dreadful day when Francey told the little lady to her face that she did not see she (the little lady) was a bit better than [Pg 3]she was, except for her clothes, poor Mrs. Smith had wept tears of sorrow and mortification, and Francey had dined on dry bread for a week--and they had all again implicitly believed, as their mother had told them, that they were only common children and Miss Dolly was a very superior being indeed--except Bet.\n",
      "Man with boy and girl\n",
      "Bet was the youngest but one, so it was the seventh time the Angel of Love had come to the cottage when he was born.\n",
      "He was particularly plain--bless his heart, just like his dear father, Mrs. Smith used to say to the servants at the Hall--and although he brought plenty of love into the poor home, unfortunately he did not bring any extra bread and butter with him.\n"
