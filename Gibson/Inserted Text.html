<h1><em>MY FRIEND DOGGIE</em><br>

<em><span class="fs70">or</span></em><br>

<span class="smcap fs80">An Only Child</span>.</h1>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case"><em>Up</em></span> at the Hall there was only one little girl. She was,
however, such a very pretty little girl, and so very
gentle and sweet-tempered, that she could hardly have
been improved upon, and all the eight children at the Lodge
loved her.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" style="max-width: 44.5em;" id="i_001">
  <img alt="Girl and dog" class="w100" src="images/i_001.jpg" id="img_images_i_001.jpg">
</figure>

<p>The eight children at the Lodge were not particularly
pretty, neither were they particularly good, but they had
warm, affectionate little hearts, and I suppose that, as each
baby brings love into the world with it, there was eight
times the amount of love in the cottage that there was at
the Hall.</p>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" style="max-width: 54.375em;" id="i_002">
  <img alt="Girl with two dogs" class="w100" src="images/i_002.jpg" id="img_images_i_002.jpg">
</figure>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<p>When the children at the cottage
looked curiously at the little lady in
her velvet and fur, their mother used
to be ashamed of them, and tell
them that beauty was only skin-deep,
and it was better to be good than
pretty—and they all believed her
except Bet, and on that dreadful day
when Francey told the little lady to
her face that she did not see she
(the little lady) was a bit better than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
she was, except for her clothes,
poor Mrs. Smith had wept tears
of sorrow and mortification, and
Francey had dined on dry bread
for a week—and they had all again
implicitly believed, as their mother
had told them, that they were only
common children and Miss Dolly
was a very superior being indeed—except
Bet.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" style="max-width: 41.6875em;" id="i_003">
  <img alt="Man with boy and girl" class="w100" src="images/i_003.jpg" id="img_images_i_003.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Bet was the youngest but one,
so it was the seventh time the
Angel of Love had come to the
cottage when he was born. He was particularly plain—bless
his heart, just like his dear father, Mrs. Smith used
to say to the servants at the Hall—and although he brought
plenty of love into the poor home, unfortunately he did not
bring any extra bread and butter with him.</p>

<p>Bet was a dreadful boy—what his mother called a
limb. He used to plant his sturdy legs apart, and gape
at Miss Dolly and the Squire, without a touch of his cap
or a pull at his rough curls, for all the world as if they
were common cottage people like himself—for sometimes
when a little common child is born the fairies forget to
tell him that he is not quite like the upper classes, and
then he is very apt to go through life never learning the
difference at all, and having the impertinence sometimes to
grow up into something quite original.</p>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" style="max-width: 43.5em;" id="i_004">
  <img alt="Girl with two younger kids" class="w100" src="images/i_004.jpg" id="img_images_i_004.jpg">
</figure>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<p>But the funny thing was that, for all his impudent
ways, it was Bet that Miss Dolly chose to love out of
all the children at the Lodge. If she ran away from the
nurse or her governess in the garden, they were sure to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>find her sitting behind a bush with Bet, sharing strawberries
on a leaf, or making cups and saucers out of acorns.</p>

<p>Her mother used to laugh, and say that an only child
must have someone to play with, and that Bet was a dear
impudent boy, with his brown curls and his twinkling eyes
and his ugly face.</p>

<p>Now Bet was very fond of animals, and the gamekeeper
had given him a spaniel puppy, and the gardener’s
boy had given him a kitty, and one winter’s morning he
had raced them down the avenue together and into
the road.</p>

<p>Just as he got through the gate of the avenue he saw
a whole lot of rough boys bounding and leaping towards
him, and before he knew what they were going to do they
had seized the poor little kitty, and were tossing it from
one to the other as if it were a ball.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" style="max-width: 50.75em;" id="i_005">
  <img alt="Boy and girl sitting" class="w100" src="images/i_005.jpg" id="img_images_i_005.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Bet was terrified and he was furious—and, above all,
he heard the mewing of the frightened kitty as she clung
with teeth and claws to the cruel hand—but Bet was only
six years old, and though he kicked and struck and fought,
the boys just laughed and shook him off as if he had
been a cross puppy, and not a very brave, angry, ugly
little boy.</p>

<p>But at that moment there
came to his ears the sweetest
sound he had ever heard—the
sound of flying feet upon the
gravel, and a furious screaming
voice, much more like an infuriated
cockatoo than a very
superior little girl.</p>

<p>“You leave that boy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
kitten alone!” she was shouting, as she came flying down
the drive in her fur cloak and scarlet hat. “You—you
cowards—I’ll call the gardeners. I’ll call the coachman.
You leave that cat alone!”</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp55" style="max-width: 62.5em;" id="i_006">
  <img alt="Group of boys playing with a cat" class="w100" src="images/i_006.jpg" id="img_images_i_006.jpg">
</figure>

<p>She had plunged into the midst of them, kicking and
hitting much harder than Bet had done, and attracting
so much attention that Smith rushed out of the cottage
with his stick and Mrs. Smith’s red face appeared at an
upper window. But Dolly had won the victory before the
reinforcements arrived. The boys had dispersed in a great
hurry at the sight of the stick and Smith’s powerful arm,
and Dolly and Bet were huddled on the bank by the
roadside together, with the poor frightened pussy clasped
in their arms. Dolly was crying, now that the need for
courage was over, and Bet was very white and very still,
for a great resolve was forming itself in his mind, and
it took all his strength to be capable of the sacrifice.
The whole family came out to comfort Dolly and dry
her tears,
and Smith
himself prepared
to escort
her back
to the house.
Her own
spaniels,
Dash and
Dandy, had
found her
out, and were
leaping joyfully
upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
her, partly from affection no doubt, but partly because
she still held the long-suffering pussy out of the way of their
frantic leaps.</p>

<p>“I’m ever so much obliged to you, Miss Dolly,” said
Mrs. Smith, wiping the mud and snow off her fur cloak,
and she looked round furtively at Bet to see if he had it in
his mind to be polite or not.</p>

<p>But there was so need to tell Bet to pull his curly locks
to-day. Even if one is an independent young Briton, with
very crude ideas of social distinctions, one is often blessed
with very strong feelings of love or gratitude, and Bet’s blue
eyes were shining.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" style="max-width: 38.25em;" id="i_007">
  <img alt="Mother and daughter" class="w100" src="images/i_007.jpg" id="img_images_i_007.jpg">
</figure>

<p>“I’ll never forget,” he said; “I’ll give you my best—always—I
won’t never forget.”</p>

<p>He choked and ran away into the house, and Mrs.
Smith excused him. “You see, he’s but young, Miss,”
she said, “and he’s not free of his words, but he’s very
much your debtor for the cat,
that he is.”</p>

<p>So Smith and the big stick,
and Dash and Dolly, strolled
away to the house together.</p>

<p>Half way along the avenue
they came upon three of the
eight children scattering salt
upon the snow, hoping it might
lodge upon the tail of a fat
robin that was hopping from twig
to twig. They shrank away out
of their father’s sight, but Dolly
could not resist stopping to see
if they succeeded. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Dash and Dandy made
such a rush at the fat
robin, both at once,
that he flew away with
a frightened chirp, and
Dolly nodded to the
children, and ran on
home.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" style="max-width: 59.25em;" id="i_008">
  <img alt="Boy sleeping with dog" class="w100" src="images/i_008.jpg" id="img_images_i_008.jpg">
</figure>

<p>But all that day Bet sat moodily in his little corner
by the grate, with the great resolve taking root in his slow
mind. To-morrow was Christmas Day and he wanted to
make Miss Dolly a present, and in all the world he had
only one thing of his very own of any value and that
was his puppy. He wanted to give it to her, and in his
heart he meant to give it to her, but it was like tearing a
very precious flower up by the roots to take this great love
out of his life; for he <em>did</em> love it. It ate out of his saucer
at meals and slept in his crib at night, and, however little
there might be to eat, Bet’s share was equally divided with
the puppy.</p>

<p>He did not tell his mother what he was thinking about,
or why his tears fell that night into the puppy’s saucer,
because she used to say to Bet sometimes that they were
too poor to be generous, and Bet did not want to hear her
say that to-night; so he crept silently to bed and laid his
cheek upon the puppy’s coat, and in two minutes they were
fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" style="max-width: 47.6875em;" id="i_009">
  <img alt="Young boy with puppy" class="w100" src="images/i_009.jpg" id="img_images_i_009.jpg">
</figure>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<p>And that was how it happened that on Christmas
morning there was an empty chair at the crowded table,
and a neglected basin of bread and milk standing on the
hob. There were no Christmas stockings for the Lodge
children and no parcels on their plates, but Mrs. Smith
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>loved all her children very much, and especially Bet, so
she kept going uneasily between the window and the fire,
saying anxiously, first to one and then to another: “Wherever
is the boy?”</p>

<p>Now the Lodge children were well brought up, and
under no circumstances were they allowed to talk at meals,
but when Mrs. Smith had repeated her question for about
the twentieth time, one fat child, bolder than the rest, said,
stolidly:</p>

<p>“He’s up to the Hall, mother; he’s going to make a
present of the pup to Miss Dolly.”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" style="max-width: 31.25em;" id="i_010">
  <img alt="Boy with puppy in hand walking up stairs" class="w100" src="images/i_010.jpg" id="img_images_i_010.jpg">
</figure>

<p>“Dear, dear,” said the mother, doubtfully, “to think
of that; whatever’ll the Squire think—dear, dear, now—the
impudence of Bet.”</p>

<p>Seeing her conversational effort was so well received the
bold little girl made another venture:</p>

<p>“He’s just <em>wropt</em> up in Miss Dolly,” she said.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said her mother, hastily,
“that’s very unbecoming, Susan—dear,
dear, what a saying; well, put his bowl
on one side, Francey, and clean up the
children for church.”</p>

<p>Bet had started in the early morning
over the crisp hard ground, with the
doomed puppy at his heels. He had
quite fought out the matter with himself,
and he felt he was <em>glad</em> to give up the
puppy—all the more glad, perhaps,
because the fight had been a hard one.
Every two or three steps he turned
to look at the soft little creature,
tumbling over itself and making frantic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>efforts to keep up with his bold strides. Once it crept on
to a bit of ice, and his blood ran cold with fear, but at last
he reached the great front steps, and sat down exhausted
with the puppy in his arms. Its tongue was out and its
head hanging, and they were both nearly asleep when the
door was opened suddenly behind them and a soft voice
said: “Why, Bet! and the puppy!”</p>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" style="max-width: 49.125em;" id="i_011">
  <img alt="Girl holding dolls with puppies and a cat on the floor" class="w100" src="images/i_011.jpg" id="img_images_i_011.jpg">
</figure>
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<p>Bet was on his feet in a minute. “It’s for Miss Dolly—I
brought it up—it’s the only thing that’s mine.”</p>

<p>“My dear little boy, Dolly will be so pleased.” Dolly’s
mother thought, with a pang, of Dolly as she had seen her
an hour ago, with arms full of toys, and her room littered
with presents, and then of that other home, so full of
children, so bare of presents, out of which another generous
gift had come for Dolly. There were eight sealed parcels
lying in the housekeeper’s room, but a generous impulse
prevented her from speaking of them to Bet just now. She
could hear Dolly on the stairs, and Bet’s solemn little voice,
and the puppy’s squeals—and she was glad to think that
she <em>had</em> remembered, and that Dolly would have the joy of
coming too when she took the eight parcels to the Lodge.
Far better than rank or distinction or money is the love that
levels all—an everlasting bond between the Hall and the Lodge.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
