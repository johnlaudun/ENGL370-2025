    "Examing more than one text is crucial in text analytics because it allows you to gain broader insights, identify patterns, and draw more valid conclusions about the subject. When you analyze larger volumes of text, several things happen that wouldn't occure with a smaller sample, such as better representation of data nad statistical reliabilty. Big data refers to datasets that are so large and complex that traditional methods of data analysis may not be sufficient. For text, this typically means having access to vast amounts of written content, such as billions of social media posts, hundreds of thousands of medical records, or millions of news aritcles."
